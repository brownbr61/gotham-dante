### Fire Genasi
_As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it._

_Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone._

## Class Bonuses

### [Heart of Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:pyromancy)
_At 1st level, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, fiery magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level (minimum of 1)._

### [Fire in the Veins](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:pyromancy)
_At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, spells you cast ignore resistance to fire damage._

### [Pyromancer's Fury](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:pyromancy)
_Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal fire damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level, and ignores resistance to fire damage._

### [Fiery Soul](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:pyromancy)
_At 18th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage._
